## **Features**

âœ… **Authentication**: Implements secure user authentication with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  
âœ… **Password Hashing**: Uses **bcryptjs** to hash passwords, preventing plain text storage.  
âœ… **Input Validation**: Validates incoming data using **zod** for integrity and consistency.  
âœ… **CORS**: Configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing securely.  
âœ… **Environment Management**: Manages sensitive data via `.env` files using **dotenv**.

### **Bonus Features**

ðŸŒŸ **Send OTP**: Leverage **nodemailer** to send One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for authentication.  
ðŸŒŸ **Optional Security Enhancements**: Add extra security layers with **helmet** and **AWS SDK** for cloud integration.
