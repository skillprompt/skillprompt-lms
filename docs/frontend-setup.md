## React Query

React Query is a powerful library developed by TanStack that simplifies data fetching and state management in React applications.
It offers a set of hooks and utilities that enable you to manage data from various sources, including REST APIs, GraphQL, or even local state, effortlessly

## setup

npm

```sh
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

yarn

```sh
yarn add react-query
```

After the library is installed in our application, create a provider and client to use React Query. You can create it in the main.tsx file

```sh
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
const queryClient = new QueryClient();
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```
